### Installation Process

There are various installation processes for different platforms, such as Windows, linux, or MacOS. The different types of instillation processes can be found here [Installation’s](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html). 

### License

1. What is the project's license?
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.  <br>

### Code Base

1. What is the primary programming language in the project? <br>
The primary programming language is C++ <br>

1. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? <br>

The development environment is CMake . Yes, there are instructions on how to download, build, and install, depending on the platform. [Link to download, build and install]( https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html) <br>

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? <br>

Yes, the project does depend on other modules. The list of modules can be found [here] (https://docs.opencv.org/master/modules.html) <br>

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample.  <br>

The code is somewhat easy to understand, but there are a few language barriers. The majority of the code is written in C++, but some of the code is written in CMake, Java, and Cuda all of which I lack familiarity with.  <br>

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).  <br>
Unfortunately, OpenHub doesn’t have it on file. By rough estimation it appears to have 2 million lines of code. <br>

1. Does the repository have tests? <br>
Other than module tests, no ,  the repository doesn’t seem to have any other tests. <br>

### Summary
Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester? <br>

I definitely think it will be a challenge, but I am more than willing to contribute to this open source software project. They are very active, in either discussion forms or issues. I am very intrigued about the idea of working on this project because of the overall goal that they have. Computer vision software is the future, and I want to become part of that. I understand that the issues might be a bit complex, but I am willing and passionate to sit down and understand it. I definitely think that this is the direction I want to head in. I definitely wish there was a code of conduct page or tests repository, it would have definitely solidify the work by tenfold. <br>
